# Multiscale

This repository contains all the routines necessary to carry out a multiscale inversion analysis, using an adjoint method and a conjugate gradient algorithm.

It contains the following directories:
- Codes: Short C routine to determine whether your computer is little endian or big endian
- Data: Routines to create the input files for the inversion (source function and initial velocity structure)
- Run: Python routines to carry out the inversion and to visualize output files
